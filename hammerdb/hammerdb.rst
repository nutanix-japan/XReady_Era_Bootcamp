------------------------------------------------
Performance Testing of MSSQL using HammerDB
------------------------------------------------

In this bonus lab you will install HammerDB tool and use it to benchmark MSSQL database performance on a given VM


Lab Agenda
+++++++++++

#. Test database performance on MS SQL database configured following Best Practices

#. Test database performance on MS SQL database configured without following Best Practices - here all the database files are located in a single OS drive

   .. note::
      This bonus lab takes between 60 and 90 minutes depending on your familiarity with MS SQL databases.

Install HammerDB
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Select your *UserXX*-MSSQLSource VM and click **Actions > Power On**. (if not already powered on)

#. Log in to the VM using Remote Desktop Client/Console using the Administrator password you configured in :ref:`deploy_mssql` lab.

#. Download the HammerDB setup binaries on your VM from `here <http://10.42.194.11/workshop_staging/HammerDB/HammerDB-3.3-Win-x86-64-Setup.exe>`_. (Copy link address)

#. Go to the downloaded location: righ-click on the file and click on Advanced.

#. Install HammerDB using the instuctions `here <https://www.hammerdb.com/docs/ch01s04.html#d0e166>`_ and make sure to install HammerDB in ``C:`` drive (default).

   .. note::
      If the installation URL doesn't work. Install the **exe** file as you would install any normal windows package. It is as simple as clicking **Next**.

#. Once installed, **Close** HammerDB window (if you chose to **Launch HammerDB**).

Database Test 1 (with best practices on SQL)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In this section you will create a sample database (tpcc) following MS SQL Best Practices for database files on different drives. Once created, you will populate the database with data using HammerDB tool and run IO tests on it.

This will give you an opportunity to learn to use HammerDB tool and prepare you for the real world DB performance testing situations.

#. Open `SQL Server Management Studio` from you VM's windows menu.

#. Enter user name: administrator and *Nutanix/4u* password and click on connect.

#. Go to Windows Explorer and create the the following folders:

   ::

     D:\data
     D:\data1
     D:\data2
     D:\logs

#. Right click on databases and select **New database**.

   .. figure:: images/newdb.png

#. Give the name of the database as **tpcc**.

#. In the Database files table, scroll and select the path for tpcc and tpcc_log folder.

#. For tpcc, set path to ``D:\data``.

#. For tpcc_log, set path to ``D:\logs``.

#. Click on **Add** button twice to create two more database files.

#. Name them as **tpcc_d1** and **tpcc_d2**.

#. Set the path for two files as ``D:\data1`` and ``D:\data2``.

#. To make sure the tables are created properly, right click on **tpcc** DB and select properties. Click on **Files** and make sure the path of the folders are set right.

#. Go to ``C:\Program Files\HammerDB-*.*\Hammerdb`` (windows batch file)

#. Double click on **SQL**

   .. figure:: images/dblclicksql.png

#. Select **SQL-Server** and **TPC-C** options and click on **OK**

   .. figure:: images/selsqltpc-c.png

#. Expand Schema Build and Double click on Options.

#. Change **Sql Server Database** name to **tpcc**.

#. Change number of warehouses to 150.

#. Change virtual users to build schema to 16.

#. Click on **OK**

   .. figure:: images/warehousevirtualusers.png

#. Double click on **Build** option. click on ok, data will start building.

   .. figure:: images/dblclickbuild.png

#. Click on **Start Transaction Counter** and observer transactions.

   .. figure:: images/starttrncnt.png

   .. figure:: images/trncnt.png

#. **Do not close** HammerDB, just **minimize** the window.

   .. note::
      If you close HammerDB, populating of data will stop

#. Go to the drives ``D:\data``, ``D:\data1``, ``D:\data2``, ``D:\logs`` and check if the size of the folders is increasing.

#. Wait until the data gets generated. This generates up to 15GB of data.

   .. note::
      It may take from 15 - 20 minutes for data population

#. Once the data is generated, open hammer db that is already minimised.

#. Click on Destroy Virtual Users.

   .. figure:: images/destroyvirtusers.png

#. Double click on **Driver Script > Options**. Make sure **SQL Server Database** name is **tpcc** (the database you created in the previous few steps).

#. Select "TPC-C driver script" as **Timed Driver Script**.

#. Leave rest of them as-is and select **OK**.

   .. note::
      **Optional:** You can also try using the option **Keying and thinking time** for making the IOPS more intensive.

   .. figure:: images/drvscript.png

#. Double click on **Load**

#. Go to **Virtual users** and click on **Options**.

#. Make sure **Virtual users** in the popped-up window is 17 and click **OK**

#. Double click on **Create** and then double click on **Run** operations.\

   .. figure:: images/setvirtusers.png

#. While IO is getting generated, click on **Transactions Counter** and note the **TPM**. (Start the TPM counter if not already started)

   .. figure:: images/multitpm.png

#. Take screenshots and send TPM results to prospective customers or use it for your own reference.


Database Test 2 (with best practices on SQL by Era)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Repeat the above steps for a *Initials*\ -MSSQL2 (one deployed using Era) server with database and log files on different drives and record the results.

..
.. Let's simulate a scenario where best practices for MS SQL databases are not followed. In this screnario the data and log files for a SQL database is in the same drive.
..
.. #. Repeat the same procedure for another database.
..
.. #. Name the datbase **tpcc1**
..
.. #. For tpcc1, set path to ``E:\data``.
..
.. #. For tpcc1_log, set path to ``E:\logs``. (create logs folder)
..
.. #. Populate the database with data using the same procedure as above in HammerDB.
..
.. #. Wait for the data to be populated
..
..    .. note::
..       It may take from 15 - 20 minutes for data population
..
.. #. Confirm data is populated using the same procedure as above.
..
.. #. Click on Destroy Virtual Users.
..
..    .. figure:: images/destroyvirtusers.png
..
.. #. Double click on **Driver Script > Options**. Make sure **SQL Server Database** name is **tpcc1** (the database you created in the previous few steps).
..
.. #. Select "TPC-C driver script" as **Timed Driver Script**.
..
.. #. Leave rest of them as-is and select **OK**.
..
..    .. note::
..     **Optional:** You can also try using the option **Keying and thinking time** for making the IOPS more intensive.
..
..    .. figure:: images/drvscript.png
..
.. #. Double click on **Load**
..
.. #. Go to **Virtual users** and click on **Options**.
..
.. #. Make sure **Virtual users** in the popped-up window is 17 and click **OK**
..
.. #. Double click on **Create** and then double click on **Run** operations.\
..
..    .. figure:: images/setvirtusers.png
..
.. #. While IO is getting generated, click on **Transactions Counter** and note the **TPM**. (Start the TPM counter if not already started)
..
..    .. figure:: images/singletpm.png
..
.. #. Take screenshots and send TPM results to prospective customers or use it for your own reference.
..
..    .. note::
..       You should now notice that a database configured withouth following best practices performs slower than the database created following best practices.
..       In this case, the database **tpcc1** is four times slower than database **tpcc**.
..
..    .. note::
..       Please note that the test used here are using heavy I/O. Consider changing them in your own test to suit customers workloads.
..
Also check the **I/O Metrics** in Prism Element for this VM to see if you can observe I/O patterns, latencies, SSD/HDD usage and block sizes of files used by the VM you are running HammerDB tests on.
