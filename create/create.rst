Create Workshop From Template
-----------------------------

The Nutanix Hands on Workshops platform provides multiple Templates allowing you to create event specific Workshops or Bootcamps quickly and easily. Creating the event specific instance from a Template allows you to customize messaging and track granular statistics for your event.

Creating A Workshop from a Template
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To start you need to know which Workshop or Bootcamp you are running (*See First Page for List of Current Bootcamps*).

#. In a browser, login to https://bootcamps.nutanix.handsonworkshops.com/profiles/login/ using OKTA.

   .. note::

   If you are not able to use OKTA, log in with your @nutanix.com email. If this is your first time logging in and OKTA does not work, create an account with your @nutanix.com email.

#. Click the dropdown by your username/email, and select **Manage Workshops**.

#. Fill out the following fields:

   - **Choose a Template** - Select your desired Template
   - **Name** - This is what will be displayed as the title of the Workshop (e.g. *Portland - May 2019 Nutanix Essentials Bootcamp*)
   - **Description** - While optional, the description allows you to provide brief context about what will be covered during the Workshop/Bootcamp or other logistical details such as address and time. **Do Not Put Passwords Here**
   - **Notes** - Optional **Do Not Put Passwords Here**

  <strong><font color="red">You will provide the registration link to your attendees prior to the event</font></strong>

   .. figure:: images/create_bootcamp_06.png

#. Copy the link (or click the **Clipboard Icon**) and open in a new browser tab.

#. This is what your Prospects / Customers / Partners will see when they use that registration link. *(They will be prompted to login or create an account)*

   .. figure:: images/create_bootcamp_07.png

#. You will provide the registration link to your attendees prior to the event, as they won't have access to the environment until you provide them with access credentials.
